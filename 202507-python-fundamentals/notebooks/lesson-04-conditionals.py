    # Lesson 04: Conditional Statements

    So far, the programs we wrote executetd line-by-line. That is, the computer *executes* every line of the written code top-to-bottom every single time. However, sometimes you want to do different things under different conditions, in which case we use *if-statements*.

    If-statements are essential in programming because they allow code to branch outâ€”think of them as decision-making tools for computers. Imagine you're planning your route home during rush hour traffic: you decide whether to take the train, car, or bike based on how much time you have. Similarly, programs need to make choices to navigate through tasks efficiently.

    In Python, if-statements are implemented using the `if` keyword. They follow a specific
    structure:

    1. **Condition:** A statement that evaluates as either `True` or `False`.
    2. **Colon:** Followed by a colon to introduce the indented block of code.
    3. **Indentation:** The code inside the if-statement is indented, and Python executes it
    only when the condition is true.

    Nothing happens when the code above is run, because the condition is not met.

    The if-statements follow the same structure.

    ```
    if CONDITION:
        EXECUTE
    ```

    Notice the tap (or 4 spaces) before `EXECUTE`? In Python, tapped lines define a *code block*. In the above code, the `EXECUTE` block is executed if and only if the condition is met for the if-statement.

    A **block** of code is a group of lines that can be executed as a single unit, typically defined by indentation.

    This structure allows for better organization and readability, particularly within control structures like if-else statements and loops. The use of indentation helps group related lines of code logically, making it easier to manage nested conditions and loops.

    A code block within an `if` statement in Python is defined as a set of statements that follow the colon (`:`) after the `if` keyword. These statements, indented to a specific level, execute only when the condition specified by the `if` statement is met. The indentation signifies which lines are part of the conditional block, allowing nested structures for more complex logic. This structure helps in organizing code and managing multiple conditions or loops within the same scope.

    ## Logical operators

    To evaluate the *condition*, we need first to talk about truth values of variables. The variables that can hold the values of `True` and `False` are called **boolean variables**, named after the English mathematician George Boole. In Python, this corresponds to the `bool` data type.

    Any expressions that result in a Boolean value, either `True` or `False`, are called *Boolean expressions*. The *condition* in the example above is of course a Boolean expression as well.

    Remember that the result of a Boolean expression is always a Boolean value, either `True` or `False`, which means that the result can be assigned into a variable.

    Usually, Boolean expressions are defined by *Boolean operators*, used to define the truth values of an expression. Here are the common Boolean operators we will be using in this course.

    ## If-else statements

    This looks a bit clumsy and repetitive. We only ever want to execute one of the if blocks, because one of the two numbers will always be either larger (or equal to) the other. So, the first conditional statement actually contains all we need here. If it is true, `x` is larger. If it is false, either `y` is larger or they are the same.

    Instead of creating a whole another conditional statement, as in the example above, it is possible to create another branch of the same conditional statement to cover all cases where the condition was false. This is called the `else` statement.

    Let's rewrite the previous example.

    ## If-elif-else statements

    Actually, in the previous example, we did not cover the last case, which is that the two numbers are the same, and therefore no number is larger than the other. Now we have more than three cases:

    1. `x` is larger
    2. `y` is larger
    3. They are the same number

    A conditional statement can be added to with an `elif` branch. It is short for the words "else if", which means the branch will contain an alternative to the original condition. Importantly, an `elif` statement is executed only if none of the preceding branches is executed.

    ## Example

    Let's finish the number comparison program that we started at the beginning of this class. The program asks for two numbers, and tells the user whichever one is larger. If the two numbers are the same, the program should print a different message accordingly.

    Please type in the first number: 5
