# Basic Python

A short course (9 lessons) teaching the basics of the Python programming language. The main goal is to introduce the basic building blocks of programming in Python along with many of the Python-specific peculiarities. The students will learn to produce Pythonic, object-oriented code with a solid understanding of the proper coding practices. 

## Prerequisites

None (see above).

## Additional Resources

Additional resources, mostly consisting of Jupyter notebooks to be used as additional exercises, will be posted here.
