# A Short Course on Statistics with R

A short course (7 scheduled sessions) on the basics of statistics using R programming language. The goal is to introduce students to the typical R workflow used in statistical data analysis and visualization.

Students will learn to perform basic statistical data analysis using the **R Programming Language**.

## Prerequisites

None. This course assumes that the student has no background in either R or statistics.
